title: Writing for Social Media

---
We use social media to build relationships with Esteemed users and share all the cool stuff we do. But it also creates opportunities to say the wrong thing, put off customers, and damage our brand. So we’re careful and deliberate in what we post to our social channels. This section lays out how we strike that delicate balance.

## Basics

Esteemed has a presence on most major social media platforms. Here are our most active accounts and what we usually post on each:

###   
**Job Postings**

Job Postings demonstrate the quality of jobs within our network, as well as help establish our online presence as tech recruiters. Use appropriate hashtags for each job, and jobs specific to each brand should be posted on their respective social sites. For example, a Drupal development opportunity should be posted on DrupalContractors, not WordPress Contractors.

### **Industry-related News** 

Industry-related news  showcase that we are paying attention to the industry and care about its future. When choosing an industry-related news article, make sure the source is VALID, does not contain more than 30% ads, and not from a competitor. For subbrands, consider using an article or an update from the domain source. For instance, a WordPress industry-related news article should be published on the WordPress social media account, not the Drupal account.

### **Featured Talent**

When featuring members of our awesome community, we should make sure to link to their LinkedIn account. Showcasing the diversity and the ability of our talent is an awesome method for generating more inbound leads once we have a following, and a way for our top performing talent to get more exposure. 

### **Company Updates**

Any particularly new or relevant information about Esteemed or any of the child brands should be shared. Likely this information will come through the CEO, alerting us to new awesome projects that we’ve completed that we can share, data about our talent network and diversity of jobs, or any additional information about the company that we deem necessary to provide to our audience.

## Guidelines

Our writing for social media should generally follow the style points outlined in the Voice and tone and Grammar and mechanics sections. Here are some additional pointers, too.

### Write short, but smart

Some social media platforms have a character limit; others don’t. But for the most part, we keep our social media copy short.

* Twitter: 280 characters.
* Facebook: No limit, but aim for 1-2 short sentences.
* Instagram: No limit, but try to keep it to 1 sentence or a short phrase. Feel free to throw in an emoji.

To write short, simplify your ideas or reduce the amount of information you’re sharing—but not by altering the spelling or punctuation of the words themselves. It’s fine to use the shorter version of some words, like “info” for “information.” But do not use numbers and letters in place of words, like “4” instead of “for” or “u” instead of “you.”

### Engagement

Do your best to adhere to Esteemed style guidelines when you’re using our social media channels to correspond with users. Use correct grammar and punctuation—and avoid excessive exclamation points.

When appropriate, you can tag the subject of your post on Twitter or Facebook. But avoid directly tweeting at or otherwise publicly tagging a post subject with messages like, “Hey, we wrote about you!” Never ask for retweets, likes, or favorites.

* Yes: “We talked with @remoteworklife about gaining independence as a contractor. 
* No: “Hey @remoteworklife, can you RT this post we wrote about you? 

### Hashtags

We employ hashtags rarely and deliberately. We may use them to promote an event or connect with users at a conference. Do not use current events or trending hashtags to promote Esteemed.

### Trending topics

Do not use social media to comment on trending topics or current events that are unrelated to Esteemed. Be aware of what’s going on in the news when you're publishing social content for Esteemed.
