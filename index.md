title: Welcome to the Esteemed Content Style Guide

---
This style guide was created for Esteemed employees, but we hope it’s helpful for other content and communications teams too. It helps us write clear and consistent content across teams and channels. Please use it as a reference when you’re writing for Esteemed.

This guide goes beyond basic grammar and style points. It’s not traditional in format or content. We break a number of grammar rules for clarity, practicality, or preference.

We’ve divided the guide by topic based on the types of content we publish, so you can reference it as needed or browse in order. The entire guide is searchable, so you can go straight to the item you’re looking for. We welcome any feedback for improving the guide.
