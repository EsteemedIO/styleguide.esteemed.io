title: Writing for Translation

---
Esteemed serves companies and members in hundreds of countries and territories, not just the United States. As our talent network grows, it becomes more and more important that our content is accessible to people around the world.

We call the process of writing a copy for translation “internationalization.” This section will address things you can do to help international audiences, including translators, better comprehend your text.

## [Basics](https://styleguide.esteemed.io/writing-for-translation.html/)

We try to write all of our content in standard, straightforward English that can be understood by users with limited English proficiency. It's much easier for a translator to clearly communicate ideas written in straightforward, uncomplicated sentences.

Here are some guiding principles for writing for international audiences:

* Use active voice. We always aim for this, but it's especially important when writing for translation.
* Use the subject-verb-object sentence structure. It’s not used by all languages, but it’s widely recognized.
* Use positive words when talking about positive situations. For example, because a question like “Don’t you think she did a great job?” begins with a negative word, a non-native English speaker may interpret its implication as negative. A better version would be “She did a good job, right?”

## Guidelines

When writing for international audiences, we generally follow what's outlined in the [Voice and tone](https://styleguide.esteemed.io/voice-and-tone.html) and [Grammar and mechanics](https://styleguide.esteemed.io/grammar-and-mechanics.html) sections. But in this section more than others, some style points contradict what's stated elsewhere in the guide. If you’re writing something to be translated, the guidelines in this section should take precedence.

### [Consider cultural differences](https://styleguide.esteemed.io/writing-for-translation.html/)

Esteemed’s voice is conversational and informal. However, in some cultures, informal text may be considered offensive. 

When writing text that will be translated, be careful about making references to things of local or regional importance. These may not be recognizable to readers outside the US.

### [Prioritize clarity](https://styleguide.esteemed.io/writing-for-translation.html/)

Keep your copy brief, but don’t sacrifice clarity for brevity. You may need to repeat or add words to make the meaning of your sentences clear to a translator.

#### Repeat verbs that have multiple subjects.

* Yes: Customers who have ordered online can pick up their food at the cashier. Walk-in customers should stop by the cashier to order their food.
* No: Customers who have ordered online or who are walk-ins should stop at the cashier to order or pick up their food.

#### Repeat helping verbs belonging to multiple verbs

* Yes: Esteemed can send your campaign on the fly or can schedule your campaign to go out at a set time.
* No: Esteemed can send your campaign on the fly or schedule your campaign to go out at a set time.

#### Repeat markers in a list or series

* Yes: Use Esteemed to send email campaigns, to manage your mailing lists, and to integrate with other applications.
* No: Use Esteemed to send email campaigns, manage your mailing lists, and integrate with other applications.

### [Avoid ambiguity and confusion](https://styleguide.esteemed.io/writing-for-translation.html/)

Many words, parts of speech, and grammar mechanics we don’t think twice about have the potential to cause confusion for translators and non-native English speakers. Here are some of the big trouble spots to avoid.

#### [Avoid unclear pronoun references](https://styleguide.esteemed.io/writing-for-translation.html/)

* Unclear pronoun references
* Descriptive gerunds
* Slang, idioms, and cliches
* Shortened words, even if they’re common in English (use “application,” not “app”)
* Uncommon foreign words (use "genuine,” not “bona fide”)
* Unnecessary abbreviations (use "for example,” not “e.g.”)
* Non-standard or indirect verb usage (use “he says,” not “he’s like” or “he was all”)
* Double negatives
* Synonyms, generally. Don't use a lot of different words for the same thing in a single piece of writing. Instead of mixing it up with “campaign,” “newsletter,” “bulletin,” etc., pick one term and stick with it.

### Numbers

#### Measurements

When writing for an international audience, use the metric system. Spell out all units and avoid abbreviation.

#### Currency

Many countries call their currency "the dollar," but the value is going to differ between countries. The US dollar is not the same as the Canadian dollar, for example. So it’s important to specify.

Indicate currency by using its 3-letter abbreviation, such as USD or CAD. Don’t use currency symbols, like $ or €. We would say 25 USD, not $25.
