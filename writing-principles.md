title: Writing Goals and Principles

---
With every piece of content we publish, we aim to:

* **Empower.** Help people understand Esteemed by using language that informs them and encourages them to make the most of our products and services.
* **Respect.** Treat readers with the respect they deserve. Put yourself in their shoes, and don’t patronize them. Remember that they have other things to do. Be considerate and inclusive. Don’t market at people; communicate with them.
* **Educate.** Tell readers what they need to know, not just what we want to say. Give them the exact information they need, along with opportunities to learn more. Remember that you’re the expert, and readers don’t have access to everything you know.
* **Guide.** Think of yourself as a tour guide of our offerings for our readers. Whether you’re orientating them on an opportunity or educating on an approach to a problem, communicate in a friendly and helpful way.
* **Be Authentic.** Understand Esteemed’s place in our users’ lives. Try to own that we are here to help and guide our users on their career journey.

In order to achieve those goals, we make sure our content is:

* **Clear.** Understand the topic you’re writing about.
* **Useful.** Before you start writing, ask yourself: What purpose does this serve? Who is going to read it? What do they need to know?
* **Friendly**. Write like a human. Don’t be afraid to break a few rules if it makes your writing more relatable.
* **Appropriate.** Write in a way that suits the situation. Just like you do in face-to-face conversations, adapt your tone depending on whom you’re writing to and what you’re writing about.
