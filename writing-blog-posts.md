title: Writing Blog Posts

---
Esteemed blog posts are written by people from all over the company. We love having experts within the Esteemed Talent Network share their ideas, concepts, and experience with other developers and clients. We believe that the person most familiar with the subject is in the best position to convey it, and the writers on the marketing team can help with brainstorming and editing as needed.

We have several blogs, including ones written by our WordPress and Drupal teams. This section will focus on the main Esteemed marketing blog, but the guidelines apply to the other channels, too. 

## Basics

We update the main Esteemed blog a couple times every week. We generally publish:

* Remote work news, insights, and assistance
* Helpful tips around maintaining your business
* User case studies and success stories

We publish blog posts that explain the “why” behind the work we do at Esteemed. We want to show people that we're an industry leader with the best talent, and we use our blog to tell the stories behind our talent.

## Guidelines

When writing for the blog, follow the style points outlined in the Voice and tone and Grammar and mechanics sections. Here are some more general pointers, too.

### Be casual, but smart

### Code

This isn’t a term paper, so there’s no need to be stuffy. Drop some knowledge while casually engaging your readers with conversational language.

### Get to the point

Get to the important stuff right away, and don’t bury the kicker. Blog posts should be scannable and easy to digest. Break up your paragraphs into short chunks of three or four sentences, and use subheads. Our users are busy, and we should always keep that in mind.

### Link it up

Feel free to link away from Esteemed if it helps you explain something.

### Make 'em LOL

Esteemed is a fun company, and we want our blog to reflect this. Feel free to throw in a joke here and there, or link out to a funny GIF or YouTube video when appropriate. Just don't overdo it.

### Use tags and keywords

In order to help your content get indexed on the site and in Google, add keywords that apply to your article. Look through existing posts for common tags. If you’re not sure if a word should be a tag, it probably shouldn’t.

### Use pictures

Include images in your blog posts when necessary. For example, if you’re explaining how to use code or providing development examples, include screenshots to demonstrate your point. Make sure to use alt text.
